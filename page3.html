        If the user correctly guesses the coin flip multiple times in a row, they earn more and more money. However, after 'x' successful guesses, if they make an incorrect prediction, they lose all the money collected so far. Still, the user can choose to press the Stop button at any time to take out their current winnings. In this case, they can start a new game using a new ticket, but the money they have already collected remains.
